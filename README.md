# ðŸ™‰ Functional Programming in Javascript.
Functional Programming(FP) is as old as programming but some of us think that it is discovered recently because we found some parts in mathematics but not in the programming world. But nowadays functional programming is in trend. Almost every programming language including Java, Python, JavaScript, etc. is adopting functional programming.

# 1. ðŸ¤–  What is functional programming (FP) 

In computer science, functional programming is a programming paradigmâ€”a style of building the structure and elements of computer programsâ€”that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data. It is a declarative programming paradigm in that programming is done with expressions or declarations instead of statements. In functional code, the output value of a function depends only on its arguments, so calling a function with the same value for an argument always produces the same result. This is in contrast to imperative programming where, in addition to a function's arguments, global program state can affect a function's resulting value. Eliminating side effects, that is, changes in state that do not depend on the function inputs, can make understanding a program easier, which is one of the key motivations for the development of functional programming.
